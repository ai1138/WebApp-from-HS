					<h2>The 80s</h2>
					Golden age hip hop is a name commonly given to mainstream hip hop music made in the late 1980s and early 1990s, typically by artists originating from the New York metropolitan area. It is said to be characterized by its diversity, quality, innovation and influence after the genre's emergence and establishment in the previous decade. There were various types of subject matter, while the music was experimental and the sampling eclectic.
					The artists most often associated with the phrase are LL Cool J, Run�D.M.C., Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys, KRS-One, Eric B. & Rakim, De La Soul, Big Daddy Kane, EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, Slick Rick, Ultramagnetic MC's, and the Jungle Brothers. Releases by these acts co-existed in this period with, and were as commercially viable as, those of early gangsta rap artists such as Ice-T, Geto Boys and N.W.A, the sex raps of 2 Live Crew and Too Short, and party-oriented music by acts such as Kid 'n Play, The Fat Boys, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince and MC Hammer.
					The golden age is noted for its innovation � a time "when it seemed that every new single reinvented the genre," according to Rolling Stone. Referring to "hip-hop in its golden age", Spin's editor-in-chief Sia Michel said, "there were so many important, groundbreaking albums coming out right about that time", and MTV's Sway Calloway added: "The thing that made that era so great is that nothing was contrived. Everything was still being discovered and everything was still innovative and new". Writer William Jelani Cobb said, "what made the era they inaugurated worthy of the term golden was the sheer number of stylistic innovations that came into existence... in these golden years, a critical mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time".
					The term "Golden age hip hop" frames the late 1980s in mainstream hip hop, said to be characterized by its diversity, quality, innovation and influence, and associated with Public Enemy, KRS-One and his Boogie Down Productions, Eric B. & Rakim, Ultramagnetic MCs,[ De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Jungle Brothers due to their themes of Afrocentricity and political militancy, their experimental music, and their eclectic sampling. This same period is sometimes referred to as "mid-school" or a "middle school" in hip hop, the phrase covering acts such as Gang Starr, The UMC's, Main Source, Lord Finesse, EPMD, Just Ice, Stetsasonic, True Mathematics, and Mantronix.
					The innovations of Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, and new school producers such as Larry Smith, and Rick Rubin of Def Jam, were quickly advanced on by the Beastie Boys, Marley Marl and his Juice Crew MCs, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, and Eric B. & Rakim. Hip-hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with the sampler technology. Rakim took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and Chuck D pushed "message rap" towards black activism. Native Tongues artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, Afrocentricity and playful energy. With the eventual commercial dominance of West Coast gangsta rap, particularly the emergence of the relaxed sounds of G-funk by the early nineties, the East Coast new school/golden age can be said to have ended, with hardcore rappers such as the Wu-Tang Clan and gangsta rappers such as Nas and The Notorious B.I.G. coming to dominate the East Coast scene.
					One of the definitive characteristics of the golden age of hip-hop is the proliferation of sample-heavy music. The ability to sample different beats from a wide variety of sources gave birth to a new breed of producers, DJs who did not necessarily need formal musical training or instruments, just an ear for sound collages. These samples were derived from a number of genres, ranging from jazz, funk and soul to rock & roll. For example, Paul's Boutique, the Beastie Boys' second studio album, drew from over 105 individual samples, 24 of which were featured on the last track of the album.
					During this time, sound bites were not limited to just music. The RZA, the de facto leader of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective from the 1990s, sampled sound clips from his own collection of 1970s kung-fu flicks to bolster and frame the group's gritty lyrical content. Many of the sample-laden albums released during this time would not be able to receive legal clearance today.
					The era also provided some of the greatest advances in rapping technique. Kool G Rap, referring to the golden age in the book How to Rap said, "that era bred rappers like a Big Daddy Kane, a KRS-One, a Rakim, a Chuck D. . . their rapping capability and ability � these dudes were phenomenal".
					Many of hip hop's biggest artists were also at their creative peak. Allmusic said the golden age "witnessed the best recordings from some of the biggest rappers in the genre's history... overwhelmingly based in New York City, golden age rap is characterized by skeletal beats, samples cribbed from hard rock or soul tracks, and tough dis raps... rhymers like PE's Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, Rakim, and LL Cool J basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop".[26]
					In addition to lyrical self-glorification, hip hop was also used as a form of social protest. Lyrical content from the era often drew attention to a variety of social issues including afrocentric living, drug use, crime and violence, religion, culture, the state of the American economy, and the modern man's struggle. Conscious and political hip hop tracks of the time were a response to the effects of American capitalism and former President Reagan's conservative political economy. According to Rose Tricia, " In rap, relationships between black cultural practice, social and economic conditions, technology, sexual and racial politics, and the institution policing of the popular terrain are complex and in constant motion. Even though hip hop was used as a mechanism for different social issues it was still very complex with issues within the movement itself.The golden age is noted for its innovation � a time "when it seemed that every new single reinvented the genre,"[2] according to Rolling Stone. Referring to "hip-hop in its golden age",[11] Spin's editor-in-chief Sia Michel said, "there were so many important, groundbreaking albums coming out right about that time",[11] and MTV's Sway Calloway added: "The thing that made that era so great is that nothing was contrived.

					There was also often an emphasis on black nationalism. Hip hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson stated, "during the golden age of hip hop, from 1987 to 1993, Afrocentric and black nationalist rap were prominent",[28] and critic Scott Thill described the time as "the golden age of hip hop, the late '80s and early '90s when the form most capably fused the militancy of its Black Panther and Watts Prophets forebears with the wide-open cultural 	experimentalism of De La Soul and others".[29]
					Stylistic variety was also prominent. MSNBC said that in the golden age, "rappers had an individual sound that was dictated by their region and their communities, not by a marketing strategist"[3] and the Village Voice referred to the golden age's "eclecticism".[30]
					Along with focusing on black nationalism, hip hop artists often talked about urban poverty. This brought many listeners to the genre who were struggling with poverty and were coping with the scourges of alcohol, drugs, and gangs in their communities.[citation needed] Public Enemy's most influential song, "Fight the Power," came out at this time; the song speaks up to the government, proclaiming that people in the ghetto have freedom of speech and rights like every other American. One line in the song, "We got to pump the stuff to make us tough from the heart" [31] grabbed listeners' attention and gave them motivation to speak out for themselves.[citation ne

					<h2>The 90s</h2>
					In 1990, Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet was a significant success with music critics and consumers.[79] It was highly contributory to hip hop's mainstream emergence in 1990, dubbed by Billboard editor Paul Grein as "the year that rap exploded".[79] In a 1990 article on its commercial breakthrough, Janice C. Thompson of Time wrote that hip hop "has grown into the most exciting development in American pop music in more than a decade."[78] Thompson noted the impact of Public Enemy's 1989 single "Fight the Power", rapper Tone Loc's single Wild Thing being the best-selling single of 1989, and that at the time of her article, nearly a third of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 were hip hop songs.
					However, hip hop was still met with resistance from black radio, including urban 	contemporary, of which Russell Simmons said in 1990, "Black radio hated rap from the start and there's still a lot of resistance to it".[80]
					MC Hammer hit mainstream success with the multi platinum album Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em. The record reached #1 and the first single, "U Can't Touch This" charted on the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. MC Hammer became one of the most successful rappers of the early nineties and one of the first household names in the genre. The album raised rap music to a new level of popularity. It was the first hip-hop album certified diamond by the RIAA for sales of over ten million.[81] It remains one of the genre's all-time best-selling albums.[82] To date, the album has sold as many as 18 million units.[83][84][85][86] Released in 1990, "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice was the first hip hop single to top the Billboard charts in the U.S. It also reached number one in the UK, Australia among others and has been credited for helping diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream audience.[87] In 1992, Dr. Dre released The Chronic. As well as helping to establish West Coast gangsta rap as more commercially viable than East Coast hip hop,[88] this album founded a style called G Funk, which soon came to dominate West Coast hip hop. The style was further developed and popularized by Snoop Dogg's 1993 album Doggystyle.
					Hip hop became a best selling music genre in the mid-1990s and the top selling music genre by 1999 with 81 million CDs sold.] By the late 1990s hip hop was artistically dominated by the Wu-Tang Clan, Diddy and the Fugees.[88] The Beastie Boys continued their success throughout the decade crossing color lines and gaining respect from many different artists.
					Record labels based out of Atlanta, St. Louis, and New Orleans gained fame for their 	local scenes. The midwest rap scene was also notable, with the fast vocal styles from artists such as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Tech N9ne, and Twista. By the end of the decade, hip hop was an integral part of popular music, and many American pop songs had hip hop components. - From Wikipedia

					<h2>The 2000s</h2>
					The popularity of hip hop music continued through the 2000s. Dr. Dre remained an important figure, and in the year 2000 produced, The Marshall Mathers LP by Eminem. Dre also produced 50 Cent's, 2003 album Get Rich or Die Tryin' which debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 charts.[106]
					Hip hop influences also found their way increasingly into mainstream pop during this period mainly the mid-2000s, as the Los Angeles style of the 1990s lost power. Nelly's debut LP, Country Grammar, sold over nine million copies. In the 2000s, crunk music, a derivative of Southern hip hop, gained considerable popularity via the likes of Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Twins. Jay-Z represented the cultural triumph of hip hop. As his career progressed, he went from performing artist to label president, head of a clothing line, club owner, and market consultant�along the way breaking Elvis Presley's record for most number one albums on the Billboard magazine charts by a solo artist.
					In addition to the mainstream success, the United States also saw the success of 		alternative hip hop in the form of performers such as The Roots, Dilated Peoples, Gnarls Barkley and Mos Def, who achieved significant recognition. Gnarls Barkley's album St. Elsewhere, which contained a fusion of funk, neo soul and hip hop, debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200 charts. In addition, Aesop Rock's 2007 album None Shall Pass was well received,[107] and reached #50 on the Billboard charts.

					<h2>Trash Rap</h2>
					In 2016 the era of mumble rap exploded. Rappers started to emerge from all over the place to launch their careers off of this new sensation. Rappers such as Lil Uzi, Lil Yachty, and Desiigner have had the utmost success in this new wave of hip hop. Other renown artist such as Future, Young Thug, and Migos have also thrived in this era. The term mumble rap is exact what is sounds like, the rappers mumble to the beat creating a somewhat satisfying flow with many ad libs. It is rarely the case that these lyrics are understood. Well known rapper Wiz Kahalifa says on hot 97, "We call it mumble rap. It ain't no disrespect to the lil homies, they don't want to rap."[156] He is addressing the fact that these so-called 'rappers' are not really rapping.
					This new genre of hip hop has upset many rappers and fans as well. Just as when the crunk and snap era of hip hop emerged there were rappers such as Ice-T, one of the originators of gangster rap, beef with Soulja Boy because he hated the new era of the music. Justin Hunt compares this beef to the beef between Pete Rock, a hip hop pioneer, and Lil Yachty in his YouTube video titled "Hip Hop Hates Mumble Rap".[157] Pete Rock aims his point of interest at Lil Yachty and Young Dolph, another mumble rap star. Even J Cole felt it was time he brought the new wave of rappers to attention. In December 2016 J cole dropped a single called "Everybody Dies" where he addresses Lil Uzi and Lil Yachty.
					Although the hip hop community has labeled these artist as 'mumble rappers', some of them do not consider themselves as rappers. Hot 97 interviewed both Lil Yachty and Lil Uzi and they both some what gave the same explanation of their craft. Lil Yachty stated he was not a rapper, nor was he a rockstar.[158] On the other hand, Lil Uzi said he was a rockstar not a rapper.[159] Despite their denial to be rappers their songs possess the fundamental basis of hip hop, the collaboration of breaks and melodies. Rapper or not they have gained quite a fanbase and still continue to grow.
					Desiigner, who almost exactly sounds like Future, released a single named Panda in December 2015. Almost a year later the single went platinum four times. This rapper is signed to Good Music and does ad libs for many songs of various artists.
